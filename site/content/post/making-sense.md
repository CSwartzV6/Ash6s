title: Razer Viper - Beautiful. I'm sending it back.

description:  I've recently grabbed some Razer products after watching countless
  videos and reading many posts insisting that their latest and greatest are
  just that. I've found this to be true of my Pro V2 wireless headset and the
  Kiyo webcam with built-in ring light. However, I unfortunately cannot say the
  same for the Viper.

I use a palm style grip, and coming from my Roccat Kova, this just doesn't have the same comfort. My palm almost feels like it is sitting on the buttons a bit. But this I could get past...

If it weren't for the mushy right-click. It appears to be a problem that haunts Razer Viper mice. Many complaints across Amazon and other platforms confirming that some are shipped with mushy bu\
ttons in one spot or another, ringing the concern bells for quality control. On my Kova I can play a game such as League of Legends all night without tired fingers. After just *one* match of LoL on my new Viper and my right click finger (middle finger) was feeling very worn out. It just didn't have the springiness pushing my finger back up. I'd hoped maybe after a bit it would wear in as some described, but this continued and it is a deal breaker.

If you have smaller hands or a different grip style (and a little luck on getting a perfectly clicky mouse) you may love this mouse. The scroll feels really good, and you can middle click without accidentally scrolling (a problem on my Kova). It's a sharp looking addition to the collection, but sadly it isn't the right one for me. According to [Razer](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/3788212891102934149/2640367909488837614#), I should try the Basilisk, Mamba or DeathAdder. The search will continue.
